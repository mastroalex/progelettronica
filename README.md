### Introduction 
The idea of the project is to show the concept and how to control gripper and rotation via sensor signals. The structure is very simple and made in full of maker and DIY philosophy, only with recycled objects. 
An example in the following figure.

The gripper has been further simplified in different version but the same project could be realized by purchasing a robot gripper.

### Getting started

### How to use
#### GY-521 
GY-521 is a module that manages the MPU-6050 sensor, a chip manufactured by Invensense, which is a IMU (Inertia Measurement Unit) sensor based on MEMS technology that contains a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope embedded in a single chip. This is a 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) IMU sensor so it gives six values as output. It also contains a temperature sensor.

The accelerometer is capable of detecting the angle of inclination along the three axes, while the gyroscope detects the angular velocity around the three axes.
GY-521 module is small in size but it is very accurate, it contains a 16-bit analog to digital conversion hardware for each channel so it captures the x, y, and z channel at the same time.
The sensor uses the I2C protocol for communication.
Two libraries are required one for the I2C and the other for communicating with MPU-6050.
 ```c
 #include <MPU6050_tockn.h>
 MPU6050 mpu6050(Wire);
 #include <Wire.h>
 ```




#### Servo 
A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.

Microservo SG90 is used. It can rotate approximately 180 degrees (90 in each direction) and works just like the standard kinds but smaller.

Position "0" (1.5 ms pulse) is middle, "90" (~2ms pulse) is middle, is all the way to the right, "-90" (~1ms pulse) is all the way to the left.
The Servo library is used to control the servo motor.
 ```c
#include <Servo.h> 
Servo servo-object-name;
```

Then use the following command to control angle from 0 to 180 degrees.

 ```c
servo-object-name.write(degrees);
```
The following diagram includes the connection for both the servo and the IMU.

#### EMG Sensor
EMG (Electromyography) sensor is able to measure a muscle's activity by monitoring the electric potential generated by muscle cells, electromyography has traditionally
been used for medical research and diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders, however now EMG sensors are used in robotic and other control systems.
This sensor amplifies and processes the electric activity of a muscle and converts it into an analog signal which can be read by any microcontroller with an 
analog-to-digital converter like Arduino.
When the muscle under test flexes, the sensors's output voltage increses.
Linked to the sensor via audio-style connector there is a cable which is connected on one side to Arduino, while on the other side ends with three snap connectors 
that attach to three electrodes.

Muscle Sensor v3 is used. It needs a positive and negative reference voltage so two 9V batteries are required.
